        Have you ever found a random playing card lying around somewhere outside?
        Pokerdex lets you turn those moments into a personal and growing collection.<br><br>
        Pokerdex is a fun and nostalgic app that helps you keep track of every real playing card you have discovered in everyday life. Whether on city streets, in parks, or while traveling, you can record each find and gradually build your own collection and collect badges. Over time, you will see which cards you have already found and which ones are still missing.
